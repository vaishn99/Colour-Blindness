# Colour-Blindness
>**Objective**: <br/>

To find the configuration responsible for causing colour blindness in the given gene sequence.

>**Abstract:** <br/>

It is found that colour blindness occurs because of the overlap between the Red and Green colour receptors’ domain.
The recipe for Red and Green sensors is stored in the  23’rd chromosome.It is also known that there are differences at 15 points between Red and Green.  Within a chromosome, information is only stored in axons. The address information for each axon is given in the script.I have attached a slide that discribes the cause of colour blindness.
